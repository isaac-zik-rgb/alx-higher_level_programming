# Project Title: Python Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)

## Description
This project is a demonstration of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) concepts using Python. ORM is a programming technique that allows developers to interact with a relational database using Python objects instead of writing SQL queries directly. This project explores how to map Python classes to database tables, perform database operations, and leverage the power of SQLAlchemy, a popular ORM library.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/orm-project.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd orm-project`
3. Create a virtual environment (recommended): `python3 -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Linux/macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
      - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
      5. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Configure your database connection details in the `config.py` file.
2. Define your Python classes that represent database tables in the `models.py` file.
3. Implement your ORM operations in the `main.py` file using SQLAlchemy.
4. Run the application: `python main.py`

## Features
- Basic ORM concepts: Mapping Python classes to database tables.
- CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete records from the database.
- Relationships: Implement relationships between tables (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many).
- SQLAlchemy: Utilize the SQLAlchemy library for powerful ORM capabilities.
- Database migration: Use Alembic for managing database schema changes.
- Data validation and constraints: Apply validation and constraints using SQLAlchemy.

## Technologies
- Python 3.x
- SQLAlchemy
- Alembic
- SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL (Choose your preferred database)
- Virtual environment (venv)
